/*

Things to test ...

kill!
  Check killing empty, within-a-line and cross-line intervals.
  Check killing empty lines, and killing across them.
  Check effects of "merge?:" and "reverse?:" [whatever they're
    supposed to be!]
  Check effect of clipboard-policy.
  Check state of history and clipboard before and after.

delete!
  Check deleting empty and {part,whole,cross}-{line,section} intervals.
  Check no empty lines (and sections/nodes?) are left behind?
  Check deleting intervals bounded bby bps with invalid indices.

[For now, I'll take the following two as being sufficiently tested by
the tests on delete!.]
merge-sections
  Check that content of resulting section is as expected.
remove-empty-nodes
  Check with start, end or both nodes having empty sections.
