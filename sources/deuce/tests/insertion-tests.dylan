// place, but we _could_ at least check that they're on a line in the
// buffer and at a valid index for that line.  Could also check that
// node-{start,end}-bps are indeed at the start/end of lines which
// have no line-{previous,next}.

/*

Things to test ...

insert! for <character>
insert! for <string>
  See insert-into-line.

insert! for <basic-interval>
  Check inserting at {start,middle,end}-of-{line,section}.
  Check for empty, single-line and multi-line intervals.
  [At the moment, we seem to be assuming that to-be-inserted intervals
    contain no <section-node>s, just <basic-node>s.  If/when we do,
    check for inserting intervals spanning 2 and 3 sections.]
  [I assume that later we may want to be able to insert "section
    breaks", if the interval spans sections.  I expect we'd have to
    create fresh sections and add the lines to them.]
  [What happens if we insert an interval into the middle of itself?!?
    If it's something bad, maybe we'd better catch that!  A: We don't
    expect to, since we normally only insert from the clipboard or
    kill-ring.  We could check for this but it would be expensive.]

insert-into-line for <text-line>, <character>
  Check inserting at -1, 0, middle-of-line, end-of-line, past-end.
  Check for '\n' and non-'\n' characters.
  Check lines with and without moving-bps.
  [Why doesn't the bp-relocating code need to check that the bps are
    <moving-bp>s?  Are all bps inserted into <text-line>s guaranteed
    to be moving?]

insert-into-line for <text-line>, <string>
  [What is the "insert-moving!(nbp, '\n')" in the ">1-'\n's" clause
    for?]
  Check inserting at -1, 0, middle-of-line, end-of-line, past-end.
  Check for strings containing 0, 1 and n '\n's; the string "\n"; and
    a string with 2/3 consecutive '\n's.
  Check lines with and without moving-bps.
  [Why doesn't the bp-relocating code need to check that the bps are
    <moving-bp>s?  Are all bps inserted into <text-line>s guaranteed
    to be moving?]

insert-into-line for <diagram-line>, XXX
  [Won't bother testing these for now.]
  [What if you insert a <string> which contains (begins/ends with?) a
    '\n'?  Will you get the same effect as if you had inserted each
    character separately, given that the <character> method treats
    '\n' specially?]

split-for-insertion
  [This is tested within the insert-into-line tests.]
  Check inserting at -1, 0, middle-of-line, end-of-line, past-end.
  Check splitting first, middle and last line in a section.

insert-moving!
  [Hardly worth testing.]
  Check that the bp points to the inserted object (and that it's == to
    the original argument)?
