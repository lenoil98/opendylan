Library Changes
===============

dylan Library
-------------

common-dylan Library
--------------------

* ``integer-to-string`` has a new *lowercase?* keyword argument. When true,
  lowercase characters are used when *base* is above 10.

io Library
----------

* The behavior of the ``%x`` format directive has changed. "%x" now outputs
  lowercase hexadecimal numbers and "%X" outputs uppercase. The old behavior
  was to always output uppercase. Fixes `bug 1054
  <https://github.com/dylan-lang/opendylan/issues/1054>`_.

system Library
--------------

c-ffi Library
-------------

network library
---------------

testworks Library
-----------------

collections Library
-------------------

* The ``table`` macro has been renamed to ``tabling``. ``table`` is not an
  unlikely name for a function parameter when writing code that generically
  operates on tables, and the existence of the ``table`` macro causes a
  confusing compiler warning for references to that name that aren't in the
  correct form.

big-integers library
--------------------

progress-stream library
-----------------------

gabriel-benchmarks library
--------------------------

Contributors
